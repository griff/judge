		<dt><center><b>1.1 Game Information</b></center>
</dt><dl>
<a name="GAME"></a>
<p></p><dt><b><tt>GAME <i>name</i></tt></b></dt><dd>
	This line simply gives the name of the game.  It is optional.  Since
	all information on a game is contained in a dedicated subdirectory
	with the same name as the game, the game name is technically known,
	but is inserted into the status file (if not already present) simply
	to aid in game identification if the status file is misplaced somehow.
	The game <tt><i>name</i></tt> <b><u>must</u></b> match the game's
	subdirectory or an error will be generated.

<a name="PHASE"></a>
<a name="AWAIT"></a>
<a name="SKIP"></a>
<p></p></dd><dt><b><tt>PHASE <i>phaseName</i></tt> -or-<br>
		  <tt>AWAIT <i>phaseName</i></tt> -or-<br>
		  <tt>SKIP <i>phaseName</i></tt></b></dt><dd>
	Specifies the current phase of the game.  If the word <tt>AWAIT</tt>
	appears, no changes can be made (except by the Master) to the status
	file, as this signifies either that results of a phase are currently
	being automatically generated by the judge (or in the case of extra phases
	unimplemented in the DPjudge code, manually generated by the Master).  The
	<tt><i>phaseName</i></tt> must either be the single word
	<tt>FORMING</tt>, the single word <tt>COMPLETED</tt>, or must be
	exactly three words in length, giving the season,
	year, and type of the current game-phase.  The year must be numeric.
	For example:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		<tt>SPRING 1901 MOVEMENT</tt><p>
	If the line begins with <tt>SKIP</tt>, this indicates that no orders
	are to be solicited for the listed phase.  This is rarely used, but one
	use for it is in Crystal Ball games that begin with an empty board --
	this allows players to enter moves (during the previous, "<tt>SKIP</tt>ped"
	movement phase) and then after locking those moves in, build their
	units in an adjustment phase.
	</p><blockquote><font color="red"><b><u>Important:</u>
	<!--
	Do not modify the <tt>PHASE</tt> for a game
	manually unless you are either adjusting a game that is already in
	progress, or setting up a game that you are about to mark as in progress
	(during the game preparation stage).
	-->
	The DPjudge will <i>automatically</i> change the
	<tt>PHASE</tt> from <tt>FORMING</tt> to (for example)
	<tt>SPRING&nbsp;1901&nbsp;MOVEMENT</tt> when the final needed player
	<tt>JOIN</tt>s,
	and will also change the <tt>PHASE</tt> to <tt>COMPLETED</tt> when the
	game completes.  In both these cases, the update to the <tt>PHASE</tt>
	line is <i><b><u>not</u></b> the only thing that must be done to change
	the game's status either to or from "active."</i>  Therefore, the
	<tt>PHASE</tt> should <i>only</i> be manually modified by the GameMaster 
	when setting up a specific position in a game <i>already in
	progress</i>.  In all other cases, allow the DPjudge to modify the
	<tt>PHASE</tt> automatically, or use the "Current Game State" pulldown
	on the Master's Web page.</b></font></blockquote>
	
<a name="FLOW"></a>
<p></p></dd><dt><b><tt>FLOW <i>season</i>:<i>phase</i>[,<i>phase</i>...] ...</tt></b></dt><dd>
	This line specifies the sequence of phases through a game year.
	Each season must be followed by a colon and then immediately (no
	intervening whitespace) by one or more phase types.  If more than
	one phase type is given, these should be separated from each other
	by commas (again, with no intervening whitespace).  This line is optional;
	if not provided, the <tt>FLOW</tt> from the game's map file is used.
	Each individual phase type must begin with a unique letter.
	Additionally, the phase names <tt>MOVEMENT</tt>, <tt>RETREATS</tt>, and
	<tt>ADJUSTMENTS</tt> are reserved (and therefore, so are the initial
	letters <tt>M</tt>, <tt>R</tt>, and <tt>A</tt>).
	<p>
	The word <tt>NEWYEAR</tt> can be used as a <tt><i>season</i></tt>, and has
	a special meaning.  A flow may contain one or more <tt>NEWYEAR</tt>
	directives, which instruct the game when to modify the game-year.  A simple
	<tt>NEWYEAR</tt> will increment the year game-by one, and
	<tt>NEWYEAR:5</tt> (for example) will increment it by five.  Any flow that
	does <i>not</i> include a <tt>NEWYEAR</tt> directive will increase the
	game-year by one after the final phase in the <tt>FLOW</tt>.
	</p><p>
	The word <tt>IFYEARDIV</tt> can also be used as a <tt><i>season</i></tt>,
	and also has a special meaning.  This word will cause the game's next phase
	to be set to the first phase in the flow if the game-year is indivisible by
	a specified number.  For example, the flow descriptor <tt>IFYEARDIV:10</tt>
	means that the flow will continue normally only if the game-year is
	divisible by ten.  Otherwise, the initial listed element of the
	<tt>FLOW</tt> will be next.  The divisor may also include a modulus.
	For example, <tt>IFYEARDIV:2=1</tt> means that the flow will be reset
	(to its first listed element) if the game-year is even, and will continue
	normally if the game-year is odd.
	</p><p>
	When any phase that
	is not supported by the DPjudge code is current, all players will
	be shown the "waiting for processing" notice on their Webpages, and
	it will be up to the Master to advance the game to the next phase
	using the <tt>PROCESS</tt> command sent to the e-mail interface.
	(Deadlines will still be in force for these phases, however.)

<a name="BEGIN"></a>
</p><p></p></dd><dt><b><tt>BEGIN <i>phaseName</i></tt></b></dt><dd>
	This line is used to specify the first phase of the game.  If not
	provided, the first phase will be taken from the map file being
	used for the game.  The <tt><i>phaseName</i></tt> must be a valid
	legal phase, such as <tt>WINTER&nbsp;1897&nbsp;ADJUSTMENTS</tt>.

<a name="ROTATE"></a>
<p></p></dd><dt><b><tt>ROTATE [CONTROL]</tt> -or-<br>
		  <tt>ROTATE AFTER [<i>phaseType</i>]...</tt> -or-<br>
		  <tt>ROTATE BEFORE <i>phaseType</i>...</tt> -or-<br>
		  <tt>ROTATE FOR <i>phaseType</i>...</tt></b></dt><dd>
	This is used to specify a rotation of power control for all
	powers in the game that are controlled by other players.  (See the
	<tt>CONTROL</tt> directive later in this documentation.)
	The "<tt>ROTATE</tt>" and "<tt>ROTATE&nbsp;CONTROL</tt>" directives
	are identical -- they direct that power control will change
	hands immediately before any phase in which the power will have
	orders to issue.  The "<tt>ROTATE&nbsp;AFTER</tt>" directive
	indicates that control will pass to the next player after each
	and every phase, regardless of whether the power will have orders
	to issue.  You may also specify a specific phase type by its first
	initial.  When used with <tt>AFTER</tt>, control will rotate after
	the specific phase type.  When used with <tt>BEFORE</tt>, control
	will rotate immediately before the given phase type.  When used with
	<tt>FOR</tt>, control will rotate before the given phase type if and
	only if the power will have orders to issue.  For example,<br><tt>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	ROTATE BEFORE MOVE</tt><br>
	indicates that control will change before each and every movement
	phase.  As a second example,<br><tt>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	ROTATE BEFORE MOVE FOR RETREAT</tt><br>
	indicates that control will rotate before each and every movement
	phase, and also, that control for any power who has a retreat order
	to issue will be rotated before the retreat phase.

<a name="NEWHOMES"></a>
<p></p></dd><dt><b><tt>NEWHOMES <i>year...</i></tt></b></dt><dd>
	This line will cause home supply centers to be completely reassigned to
	all players during the adjustment phase of the specified game-year(s).
	Each power's home SC's will be all of the centers he owns at the time.
	Note that any <tt>NEWHOMES</tt> line in the game status file will
	<i>completely replace and override</i> any <tt>NEWHOMES</tt> line that
	may appear in the game's <a href="http://www.floc.net/dpjudge?page=Map">map description file</a>.

<a name="DEADLINE"></a>
<p></p></dd><dt><b><tt>DEADLINE <i>yyyymmddhhmm</i></tt></b></dt><dd>
	This line specifies the time and date of the current deadline.  The
	system will automatically update this line when a move processes,
	if and only if the game is being run on the DPjudge (if run on the
	Ken Lowe judge, this line should not appear, and will be ignored).
	<p>
	The DPjudge will automatically set the initial deadline of the game when
	the game begins.  The initial deadline will be twice as long as a normal
	deadline for its type of phase (see <tt>TIMING</tt>, below).
	</p><p>
	The DPjudge will never automatically set a deadline that is earlier than
	any <i>current</i> value of <tt>DEADLINE</tt> (though of course the GM
	may manually move the current deadline earlier).
	</p><p>
	Note that the deadline should be expressed in the game's local time
	<tt>ZONE</tt> (see below).

<a name="ZONE"></a>
</p><p></p></dd><dt><b><tt>ZONE <i>timeZone</i></tt></b></dt><dd>
	Specifies the time zone for the game, as an alphabetic string recognized
	by the underlying computing system.  Some example <tt>ZONE</tt>s are:
	<tt>America/New_York</tt>, <tt>America/Denver</tt>, <tt>Europe/Paris</tt>,
	<tt>Europe/London</tt>, etc.  Games without a <tt>ZONE</tt> line will run
	on GMT.

<a name="timing"></a>
<p></p></dd><dt><b><tt>TIMING <i>key value</i>...</tt></b></dt><dd>
	This line specifies the timing data used to set deadlines.  It
	consists of any number of key/value pairs, which are recognized as
	follows:
	<dl>
	<dt><b><tt>AT <i>hh:mm</i></tt></b>
	</dt><dd>Specifies the time-of-day at which all deadlines should occur.
		The hour is specified using a 24-hour clock, and based at the
		DPjudge's timezone.  <i>Note that when a deadline is to be set
		less than 12 hours in the future, </i><tt>AT</tt><i> is ignored.</i>
		Otherwise, all deadlines will fall at the next occuring specified
		time-of-day after the requisite delay period (see below).
	</dd><dt><b><tt>DAYS <i>dayList</i></tt></b>
	</dt><dd>Specifies the days of the week on which the deadline could fall.
		The <tt><i>dayList</i></tt> must be seven characters in length, with
		the first character representing Sunday and each subsequent
		letter representing Monday, Tuesday, etc.  The letter at each
		position must either be the first letter of the day name (that
		is, <tt>S</tt> for Sunday, etc.), which indicates that the deadline
		<i>may</i> fall on that day of the week, or a dash (<tt>-</tt>),
		which indicates that it may not.  If not provided, the game will
		use <tt>-MTWTF-</tt> as its <tt>DAYS</tt> control.  If the day-letter
		is in <i>UPPER-CASE</i>, this indicates that deadlines for <i>any</i>
		phase may be set on that day.  If it is in <i>lower-case</i>, this
		indicates that movement phase deadlines may <i><u>not</u></i> be
		set on that day.  <i>(Therefore, at least one of the days must be
		specified in upper-case.)</i>
	</dd><dt><b><tt>NEXT <i>delay</i></tt></b>
	</dt><dd>Specifies the default time period to be used to set the next
		deadline.  The <tt><i>delay</i></tt> must be some positive whole
		number followed by either <tt>M</tt> (for minutes), <tt>H</tt>
		(for hours), <tt>D</tt> (for days), or <tt>W</tt> (for weeks).
		<i>See below for the default value if no </i><tt>NEXT</tt><i>
		control is given.</i>
	</dd><dt><b><tt><i>phaseType delay</i></tt></b>
	</dt><dd>Specifies a time period to be used (<i>instead of</i> the value
		from <tt>NEXT</tt>) for any phase whose final word begins with
		the letters making up <tt><i>phaseType</i></tt>.  For example,
		to set a game to have one-day deadlines for all phases except
		movement phases, which should have three-day deadlines (note that
		these are the default settings for any game not given a <tt>NEXT</tt>
		or appropriate <tt><i>phaseType</i></tt> control), use:<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		<tt>TIMING NEXT 1D MOVE 3D</tt><br>
	</dd><dt><b><tt>WARN <i>delay</i>[,<i>delay...</i>]</tt></b>
	</dt><dd>Specifies a time span <i>before</i> the deadline at which time
		any players who have not yet submitted orders will be sent a "friendly
		reminder." If this option is not specified, warning is given four
		hours before the deadline.  To prevent warnings from being given,
		specify a <tt><i>delay</i></tt> of <tt>0</tt> (or any value
		greater than the length of the deadline delay).  Multiple warnings
		may be specified, by separating the time controls from each other
		using a comma with no whitespace.  For example, to specify that
		warnings should be given to players without submitted orders one
		day before the deadline and then again at twelve hours and at six
		hours before the deadline, use:<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		<tt>TIMING WARN 1D,12H,6H</tt><br>
	</dd><dt><b><tt>GRACE <i>delay</i></tt></b>
	</dt><dd>Specifies a time span <i>after</i> the deadline.  Whenever that time
	    span expires before the game-phase processes, any player who still has
		not submitted orders will either be automatically resigned or (in games
		using the <tt>CIVIL_DISORDER</tt> rule) declared to be in civil
		disorder.  In games with<u>out</u> a <tt>GRACE</tt> period set in
		the <tt>TIMING</tt> line:
		<ul><li>players are <i>never</i> automatically resigned (note that
		immediate resignation of late players when the deadline hits can be
		specified by setting the grace period to zero, such as
		<tt>GRACE&nbsp;0H</tt>), and
		</li><li>civil disorder processing (in games using the
		<tt>CIVIL_DISORDER</tt> rule) occurs at the deadline (no waiting).
		</li></ul>
	</dd><dt><b><tt>NOT <i>vacationInfo</i></tt></b>
	</dt><dd>Specifies one or more upcoming vacations, during which time no
		deadline should be set.  The format of <tt><i>vacationInfo</i></tt>
		is the same as the format of the game's <tt>DEADLINE</tt> (that is,
		<tt><i>yyyymmddhhmm</i></tt> but can be shortened in length to omit
		days, hours, or minutes).  A vacation spanning more than a single day
		can be specified by listing the first and last day of the suspension
		separated by a dash (<tt>-</tt>).  The first day may be omitted,
		indicating a suspension from the current date.  Multiple vacations
		can be listed by separating them from each other with a comma (and
		<b><i>no</i></b> whitespace).  For example:<br><tt>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			TIMING NOT 20040831,20040920-20040927</tt><br>
			<!--
				How totally weird!  The first time this was used
				in practice was for 19990920-19990927, long AFTER
				I had written the above example!
				(Note:  In 2003, I changed the year to 2004
				to make a more relevant example.)
			-->
		specifies that no deadline should occur on 31 August 2004 or between
		20 September and 27 September (inclusive) of 2004.  Vacations are
		removed automatically whenever a deadline is set beyond the end
		of the vacation.
		<br><tt>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			TIMING NOT -20020812</tt><br>
		specifies that the next deadline should not occur until on or after
		12 August 2002.
	</dd></dl>

<a name="DELAY"></a>
<p></p></dd><dt><b><tt>DELAY <i>delayCount</i></tt></b></dt><dd>
	Specifies the number of deadline checks (which happen automatically
	every twenty minutes) that should occur <i>without</i> processing this
	game, despite the fact that the game is ready for processing.
	The <tt><i>delayCount</i></tt> is decremented once when each
	such deadline check occurs.  This line is automatically inserted (with
	a <tt><i>delayCount</i></tt> of <tt>1</tt>) when the last player
	enters orders for a turn (assuming there is no outstanding "wait for the
	deadline" request), and is also set to <tt>24</tt> (eight hours)
	when a late notice is sent out.  Note that a <tt>PROCESS</tt> command
	sent to the e-mail interface will ignore any <tt>DELAY</tt> and will
	process the game (if ready for processing) immediately.  Whenever a game
	is <tt>PREVIEW</tt>ed automatically, the <tt>DELAY</tt> is set to
	<tt>72</tt>, which is the (one full day) maximum allowable setting.

<a name="JUDGE"></a>
<p></p></dd><dt><b><tt>JUDGE <i>judgeAddr [otherInfo]</i></tt></b></dt><dd>
	Specifies the Ken Lowe judge on which the game is being run.  If the
	game is not being run on a Ken Lowe judge, this line should <i>not</i>
	appear in the status file.  The <tt><i>judgeAddr</i></tt> is the
	e-mail address of the judge, and any <tt><i>otherInfo</i></tt> on the
	line is ignored but will appear on the Web in the description table for
	the game.

<a name="PRIVATE"></a>
<p></p></dd><dt><b><tt>PRIVATE <i>privacyWord</i></tt></b></dt><dd>
	Used to designate a game open only to invited players (who have been
	given the <tt><i>privacyWord</i></tt> by the GameMaster).  The privacy
	keyword specified is required after a player's password in a
	<tt>JOIN</tt>, <tt>TAKEOVER</tt>, or similar command.  By marking a
	game <tt>PRIVATE</tt> in this way, only invited players should be able
	to get into the game.

<a name="RULE"></a>
<p></p></dd><dt><b><tt>RULE <i>rule</i>...</tt></b></dt><dd>
	Specifies one or more rule that will be in force for the game.  Consult
	the <a href="http://www.floc.net/dpjudge?page=Rules">complete set of rules</a> for details on the
	functionality of any specific <tt>RULE</tt>.

<a name="MAP"></a>
<p></p></dd><dt><b><tt>MAP <i>mapName</i></tt></b></dt><dd>
	Specifies the game map to be used.  If not given, the
	<tt><i>mapName</i></tt> will default to <tt>standard</tt>.
	Map files have the extension <tt>.map</tt> and must be installed
	in the map directory at the DPjudge site.  
	The <a href="http://www.floc.net/dpjudge?page=Map">map file syntax description</a> should be
	consulted to create any new map.  The supported maps are:

<a name="RESERVES"></a>
<p></p></dd><dt><b><tt>RESERVES <i>power...</i></tt></b></dt><dd>
	Each time the name of a <tt><i>power</i></tt> appears within a
	<tt>RESERVES</tt> line, the power is eligible to maintain one extra unit,
	over and above the power's supply center count.  However, this is only
	true if the power owns at least one of its original home centers.  Note
	that use of a <tt>RESERVES</tt> line in the game status file will
	<b>completely <u>override</u></b> any reserves settings that are given

	<tt>MILITIA</tt> line, the power is eligible to maintain one extra unit,
	over and above the power's supply center count <i>for each of the power's
	own units that is positioned atop one of his home supply centers at
	the time of the adjustment phase</i>.  Note

<a name="ALLOW"></a>
<p></p></dd><dt><b><tt>ALLOW <i>nonMapPowerType...</i></tt></b></dt><dd>
	Permits players to assume roles other than leaders of map powers.
	Observers are <tt>ALLOW</tt>ed by default, but other types of players
	may be allowed into the game and may play various roles as supported
	by the code.  For example, Exchange variant games <tt>ALLOW INVESTOR</tt>s
	who can serve as controller of a power.

<a name="PROPOSAL"></a>
<p></p></dd><dt><b><tt>PROPOSAL <i>result proposingPower</i></tt></b></dt><dd>
	This line will appear only in games that use the
	<tt>PROPOSE_DIAS</tt> rule.  It specifies the currently
	proposed game conclusion.  All players owning supply centers will be
	permitted to vote on this proposal.  (A "veto" vote will
	remove the <tt>PROPOSAL</tt>; otherwise, if all players agree to it,
	the game ends as proposed.)

	Specifies the history of all players of the power, including the present
	player.  The <tt><i>playerData</i></tt> is the player's DPPD ID number,
	e-mail address, and name, given in standard DPPD format.  For example:<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	
	<tt>PLAYER #42|joe@blow.com|Joe_Blow</tt><br>
	The <tt><i>phase</i></tt> is the

	took over the power (and therefore the phase in which the prior player
	resigned the power).
	Any <tt><i>priorPlayerData</i></tt> is similarly formatted, and provides
	a history of all prior players of a power.  For example:<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	
	<tt>PLAYER #42|joe@blow.com|Joe_Blow S1911R NO-ID|john@doe.net|</tt>
	<br>
	would indicate that <tt>john@doe.net</tt> (who has no DPPD ID number,
	and therefore his name is not known) played the power
	until the Spring 1911 Retreat phase, when Joe Blow (DPPD ID number 42)
	took over.  Before Joe Blow sent in his
	<tt>TAKEOVER</tt> command, the <tt>PLAYER</tt> line looked like this:<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	
	<tt>PLAYER RESIGNED S1911R NO-ID|john@doe.net|</tt><br>
	If the first word on a <tt>PLAYER</tt> line is <tt>DUMMY</tt> or
	<tt>RESIGNED</tt>, the player is not e-mailable.
	<blockquote>
	<b><font color="red"><u>Important:</u> A Master should <i>never</i>

	<tt>RESIGN</tt> and <tt>TAKEOVER</tt> commands are received!</font></b>
	</blockquote>
	<ul>
	<li><tt>DUMMY</tt> is used if the power will or may receive orders without
	a specific person playing the power (for example, the Master could enter
	orders for the power, or other players could be responsible for entering
	the orders, etc.), or no orders will be entered for it at all (civil
	disorder).
	A Master
	may create <tt>DUMMY</tt> powers before game-start (that is, by adding
	<dd><tt>POWER POWER#1</tt></dd><dd><tt>PLAYER DUMMY</tt><br>
	(etc., etc.) to the status file to cause a certain number of powers to
	be unassigned to human players.
	If the <tt>CD_DUMMIES</tt> rule is in effect, <tt>DUMMY</tt>
	powers without orders will be considered to be in civil disorder
	as soon as all other powers either have submitted orders (and not set their
	<tt>WAIT</tt> flag) or have been declared in civil disorder (by the
	operation of the <tt>CIVIL_DISORDER</tt> rule).
	</dd></li><li><tt>RESIGNED</tt> is used when a position is in need of replacement,
	and a <tt>NEED</tt> line should appear in the status file describing
	the missing position.
	If the <tt>CIVIL_DISORDER</tt> rule is in effect, any power without
	submitted orders (including <tt>DUMMY</tt> powers, but <i><u>not</u></i>
	including those marked <tt>RESIGNED</tt>), will be considered to be in
	civil disorder when a deadline occurs, and the phase will process
	without orders from the power.

	<i>Note that while a player may change his <tt>ADDRESS</tt> information

	Only the Master may do so by modification of the status file.</i>

<a name="PASSWORD"></a>
<p></p></dd><dt><b><tt>PASSWORD <i>password</i></tt></b></dt><dd>

	power that has a <tt>CONTROL</tt>.

<a name="CONTROL"></a>
<p></p></dd><dt><b><tt>CONTROL <i>powerName</i>...</tt></b></dt><dd>
	Specifies a list of one or more players who may take control (for
	order entry, press writing, etc.) of the power.  This list is used
	by the <tt>ROTATE</tt> command to cause power control to be rotated
	through other players.  The first player in the list is the player
	currently in control of the power, and the list will rotate from
	the last power listed back to the first power.
	This line may not appear for any power that has a
	<tt>PASSWORD</tt>.  Powers with another player in <tt>CONTROL</tt>
	are not shown in the list of powers that can be "logged on," but
	if a player is in <tt>CONTROL</tt> of a power, that player will be
	able to log in as that power from his own page.  For example:<br><tt>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	CONTROL AUSTRIA FRANCE ITALY RUSSIA</tt><br>
	indicates that the power is currently controlled by Austria, and that
	the next time control is <tt>ROTATE</tt>d, it will be controlled by
	France, and then on the next rotation, by Italy, etc.  The <tt>CONTROL</tt>
	scheme is used when setting up a "Missing Man" variant game.  In the
	e-mailed <tt>CREATE</tt> message (or in the status file before the
	players <tt>JOIN</tt>), the Master would create <tt>POWER</tt> stanzas
	for any powers not to be played.  For example, if Italy and Germany
	are to be played missing, controlled by the other players, the status
	file could contain:<br><tt>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	POWER ITALY<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	CONTROL ENGLAND FRANCE RUSSIA TURKEY AUSTRIA</tt><p>

	In games using the <tt>PROPOSE_DIAS</tt> (or the <tt>HIDE_PROPOSER</tt>)
	rule, the vote may only be 
	<tt>YES</tt>, which indicates that the player is in agreement with
	the current <tt>PROPOSAL</tt>.  (If any player ever votes otherwise,
	the proposal and all votes for it will be forgotten.)
	In games <i>not</i> using the <tt>PROPOSE_DIAS</tt>
	rule, each player votes either for a solo victory for himself,
	or a loss (meaning that the votes of the other players will be used
	to determine any game resolution) or for a maximum size of draw (including
	his power) that he will accept.  In games not using the <tt>NO_DIAS</tt>
	rule, the only allowable <tt><i>n</i></tt> value in an <tt><i>n</i>WAY</tt>
	vote is greater than or equal to the number of players owning supply
	centers (this signifies a vote for a draw including all survivors).

<a name="OWNS"></a>
<p></p></dd><dt><b><tt>OWNS <i>center...</i></tt></b></dt><dd>
	Specifies all supply centers owned by a power.  In the initial phase of
	the game (only), one or more of the <tt><i>center</i></tt>s may be
	<tt>SC!</tt> to indicate an ability to build in any unowned home center
	and thereby gain control of that center.  It may also be <tt>SC?</tt> to
	indicate an ability to build in any <i>unoccupied</i> home center and
	<i>not</i> take control of the center.  Finally, it may be <tt>SC*</tt>
	to indicate an ability to build in one of that power's partisan build

<a name="WAIT"></a>
<p></p></dd><dt><b><tt>WAIT</tt></b></dt><dd>

<p></p></dd><dt><b><tt><i>unit</i></tt> -or-<br>
		  <tt><i>unit</i> --&gt; <i>retreatList</i></tt></b></dt><dd>
	Specifies a unit (type and position) owned by the power.  If a unit
	is in retreat from a location, it is followed by an arrow and a
	<tt><i>retreatList</i></tt>, which is a space-separated list of all
	the possible locations to which the unit may legally retreat.

<a name="RETREAT"></a>
<p></p></dd><dt><b><tt>RETREAT <i>unit retreatOrder</i></tt></b></dt><dd>

<a name="MSG"></a>
<p></p></dd><dt><b><tt>MSG <i>message</i></tt></b></dt><dd>
	Specifies a <tt><i>message</i></tt> to be shown to the player on his

	and updated at will by the Master.

<a name="OMNISCIENT"></a>
<p></p></dd><dt><b><tt>OMNISCIENT</tt></b></dt><dd>
	If this line appears, the power's password can be used
	for read-only viewing of all other power's Web pages (except the Master),
	and the player will receive a copy of all press messages.

<a name="HOME"></a>
<p></p></dd><dt><b><tt>HOME <i>sc...</i></tt></b></dt><dd>
	Provides a list of home supply centers (using the DPjudge's standard
	place-name abbreviations), if different from those given in the game's
	map file.  This line is used in games in which the home supply centers
	for powers will change during the game.  The line is automatically
	added on any schedule specified in the <tt>.map</tt> file for the
	variant.

<a name="FUNDS"></a>
<p></p></dd><dt><b><tt>FUNDS [<i>fund</i>...]</tt></b></dt><dd>
	Specifies the funds at the player's disposal.  A
	<tt><i>fund</i></tt> is either of the form <tt>$<i>num</i></tt>
	(which specifies the power's cash-on-hand) or <tt><i>numCURRENCY</i></tt>,
	which specifies his holdings in 
	some other currency.  For example, a power with thirty-four units of cash,
	twelve units of stock in England, and twenty-two units of postage (to
	use in sending press messages) might be written:<br><tt>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		FUNDS $34 12E 22c</tt><br>
	Obviously, the <tt>FUNDS</tt> line is variant-specific, and it is
	not used in the standard game.

In addition to the status file for each game (the lines within which are
described above), there is also a separate, single "main status
file" used by the DPjudge to track and control all its games.  Each line
in this "main status file"
contains (in a space-separated list) the following information on a
single game:  the game name, its rule variant (<tt>standard</tt>,
<tt>payola</tt>, etc.), its general status (<tt>active</tt>,
<tt>forming</tt>, <tt>waiting</tt>, <tt>completed</tt>),
and then any number of other flags controllable only by the system
and/or the judgekeeper (<tt>unlisted</tt>,
<tt>suspect</tt>, <tt>corrupt</tt>, <tt>held</tt>, etc.).  This
overall status file is directly editable by the judgekeeper only.
A game's Master cannot look at or modify the data
for any game in the "main status file" other than through the supported Web and
e-mail functionality of the DPjudge.  A "suspect" game will be automatically
monitored by the judgekeeper, a "corrupt" game will be locked against all
changes, even by its Master, a "held" game will never be examined by the
deadline checker (until its "held" status is removed), and an "unlisted" game
will not show up in any list of games being run on the DPjudge.
